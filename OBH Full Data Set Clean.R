## DATA SETUP SCRIPT FOR Potential Predictors of OBH Client Success

# Data set from National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs Practive Research Network (NATSAP PRN)
# Access to this dataset requires a Research Use Agreement because it includes sensitive adolescent 
# mental health records.  Thus, a link to the dataset is not included in this script.

## ROUTINE OUTCOME MONITORING VARIABLE CREATION (rom)----

# Some programs collect YOQ data at additional points between intake and discharge
# The columns are coded to reflect the  timepoint of data collection
## ex. A0 = Day of Admission, A15 = 15 days after Admission, D0 = Day of Discharge, etc.
# Here we find the cases that have ROM data available, i.e. an data entry in the columns between A0 and D0
# Some programs will record a client's discharge data in both the D0 entry and the time point closest to when they leave
## ex. if a client leaves after 1 month, a program may record their discharge YOQ as both A30 and D0
# These cases did not meet the criteria for the ROM

# Create new columns with only routine outcome monitoring
