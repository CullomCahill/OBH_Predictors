## Change Category formula

REPHRASE
These groupings are based on a combination of a clientâ€™s discharge score as well as whether or not they met the RCI (see Table 2).  As outlined in this table, clients who met the RCI fall into either the Recovered or Improved category.



## Change category frequency  
```{r change_cat_tab}


# Set up frequency table of clinical change categories
change_cat_tab <- obh %>% group_by(change_cat_client) %>% tally() %>% 
  mutate(change_cat_client = recode(change_cat_client, rec = "recovered", imp = "improved",
                                    unch = "unchanged", nocl = "non_clinical", det = "deteriorated")) %>% 
  mutate(perc = round(n/2470*100,2))


kable(change_cat_tab)

```
For the purpose of this study, we are going to dummy code an RCI variable

# Chi-Squared on groups 

Do we want to run this with our dummy variable or full clinical change categories?   
Think we'll want to run rci because that will be what we are feeding into the logistic regression

```{r chisq}

# Subset just tested variables
obh_sel <- obh %>% select(rci, gender, adopted, attention_issue, autism, conduct_disorder, depression, substance_abuse, trauma_related_issue, rom, program_need, change_desire, prior_prog, progress_need, transport, z_dif_cat)



combos <- combn(ncol(obh_sel),2)
# Only want 1:13 ie. combos with rci
combos <- combos[,1:15]
x2_test <- plyr::adply(combos, 2, function(x) {
  test <- chisq.test(obh_sel[, x[1]], obh_sel[, x[2]])

  out <- data.frame("Row" = colnames(obh_sel)[x[1]]
                    , "Column" = colnames(obh_sel[x[2]])
