# OBH_Predictors
Predictors at intake of OBH client Success using logistic regression

Analysis of adolescents attending Outdoor Behavioral Healthcare (OBH) programs which are part of the National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs Practice Research Network (NATSAP PRN) in the United States.  For more information visit natsap.org and obhcouncil.com.  

The most significant and actionable finding from this research was the impact Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) had on client's scores.  ROM is defined as routinelty administarating mental health assessements to individuals.  **Inidividuals who had ROM data present had a 12% higher probability of reaching the bench marks for program success (66.67% for rom vs 54.57% of overall sample).**  It was not recorded if this information was utalized in a client's session of if just merely administrating the assessment accounted for the difference.   

The following is detailed explanation of a working paper to be submitted for peer review to the journal of Residential Treatment for Children & Youth.  

## Objective  

To determine if there are any significant predictors of adolescent client success in OBH treatment at intake and the strength of these relationships.  

"Success" in this paper is defined as a client meeting the Reliable Change Index (RCI) when their intake and discharge scores were compared.  

## Data Description

Predictor variables used in this study were selected based on presence in other OBH studies.  

**Demographic Variables**
  * Gender  
  * Adopted  
  
**Diagnosis**
  * Attention Issue  
  * Autism  
  * Conduct Disorder  
  * Depression  
  * Substance Abuse  
  * Trauma Related Issues  
  
**Scale Questions asked at intake**
  * It makes sense for me to be in this therapeutic program. (program_need)  
  * I would like to make a positive change in my life. (change_desire)  
  * Prior to coming to this program, how much therapeutic progress do you believe you have made by previously engaging in therapy? (prior_prog)  
  * How much therapeutic progress do you believe you need to make at this current program? (progress_need)
  
**Other**  
  * Routine Outcome Monitoring Status (ROM)
  * Was the client transported to the program  
  * Difference in intake scores between parents and their children


## Results

Overall, 54.57% of the individuals in this study experienced successful treatment gains, defined as meeting the RCI, and 45.43% did not.  Several variables proved to be meaningful predictors of clinically significant change from the logistic regression model.  Meaningful predictor variables are listed below in order of decreasing odds ratio:  

* High Scoring Student - 2.45 *(compared to students who scored similar to parents)*  
* Routine Outcome Monitoring - 2.00  
* Depression - 1.48  
* Age at intake - 1.14  
* Progress Need - 1.04  
* Prior Progress - .95  
* Gender Male - .65 *(.65 compared to when gender is female)*  
* High Scoring Parents - .44 *(compared to students who scored similar to parents)*
